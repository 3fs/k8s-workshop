# [Workshop](../README.md) &raquo; Helm basics

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications.
Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

- Helm manages releases (installations) of your charts - templates of kubernetes objects.
- Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD, or wherever you want it to run.
- Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  - A description of the package (`Chart.yaml`)
  - One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
- Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories
  (same as Debian or RedHat packages)

This guide covers how you can quickly get started using Helm.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for a successful and properly secured
use of Helm.

1. A Kubernetes cluster
2. Preconfigured container used for task in previous task: [Instructions](../02_kubernetes/README.md#access-to-your-namespace-in-workshop-k8s-cluster)
3. Installed helm client (already installed in the container)

## Introduction

In this tasks we will cover installing DokuWiki software into k8s
cluster from official chart available
[here](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/dokuwiki).

The chart provides multiple configuration options. For the purpose of the
following tasks, we will use change few of them.

All configuration values are available
[here](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/dokuwiki#configuration).

## Tasks

- [Inspect upgrade](./02_inspect_upgrade.md)
- [Delete release](./03_delete_release.md)
