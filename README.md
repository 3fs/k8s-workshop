# 3fs k8s workshop

Whole k8s workshop materials will be available in this github repository.

The workshop hands-on tasks will heavily rely on Docker and to speed up the start of the workshop, please install it in advance.

The instructions how to install Docker can be found [here](./00_prerequisites/docker_installation.md).
