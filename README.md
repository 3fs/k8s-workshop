This workshop is intended for users who are entering the world of Kubernetes and
would like to have some hands-on expirience with deployment of simple services
to Google Cloud Kubernetes service.

Workshop is devided into two parts:

- presentation Introduction to Kubernetes covering:
  - containers
  - kubernetes resources
  - kubernetes tooling (kubectl ...)
  - helm packaging
- hands-on tasks:
  - docker basics
  - kubectl
  - helm basics
  - custom helm deployment
  - advanced helm deployment

## Hands-on

Hands-on tasks are split into four major parts:

- [Containers](./01_containers/README.md)
- [Kubernetes](./02_kubernetes/README.md)
- [Helm](./03_helm/README.md)
- [Custom Helm](./04_custom_helm/README.md)

Each part has several different tasks with the solution provided either by
screenshare, file or command outputs.

Every participant received a `CODE`, two words combined with a dash, which you
will need to be able to access kubernetes cluster. This `CODE` will also be
referenced in the tasks. If you were not assigned a `CODE`, ask the instructor.

If you need help with the task ask one of the instructors for help. We will be
glad to help you out.
